        review: "Isn't funny how anytime a great director creates a documentary they turn out great and we hardly see the hand of the director? Anyways, Let It Be is like a bad penny. Every couple of years there is some new content or revision to it. This however is the coda. First the quality of the film is incredible. You can see hairs on the mic. There are points in the film that your forget that your watching a show taped 50 years ago and you feel as though your sitting on an amp besides the band. The power dynamic of the band was clearly on display in this film. After the entire time of Paul not knowing how and if the concert would work, his look when he sees the police and then the extra Get Back to finish it off.... classic."

        review: "Squid Game was a really good show that benefits from the lack of any quality television coming out. Part Battle Royale, part Willy Wonka. The dubbing was actually well done for once. It was all around a high quality production. But there are certainly parts that wouldn't hold up to scrutiny and plot lines that the show could have done without. I think that the dialogue of the rich people was down right horrible and the very definition of an exposition dump. I didn't mind the ending even though it seemed tacked on."

        review: "You would think that it would be dated, it somewhat was when I was watching it in syndication in the 90's. But as time has gone on it has become distinct. Vice starts with on of the greatest pilot episodes ever and only starts to fall of in about the fourth season. Much like all network show you could trim about 4 episodes from every season. The come in late and leave early storytelling is sadly lacking today. There are probably 20 episodes that are great as just standalone stories. The boxing episode is one of the biggest gut punches up until Law and Order lost a ADA."

        review: "The series hits all the necessary beats and is relatively centered. Some of the color looks amazing but some of it looks down right awful. My real criticism comes from the over use of the same footage. During the first ten episodes you believe that what you are seeing is from that exact moment, but during the last few episodes the footage is reused and over used casting doubt to the origin and time frame of the images."

People have known about this footage that the NBA had been hiding for 20 years and it was thought that it would never be seen. I was shocked that how little young people knew about Jordan and that their eyes were opened by this doc. I knew about almost every Hall of Fame player and I didn't have on demand highlights at a finger click. How can you love a sport and not know it's history. The doc really just cements Jordan as the greatest."

        review: "People like to lament that we'll never see anything like that anymore while also saying that what just happened is the greatest thing to ever happen. But with the way creators today basically spoon feed their viewers both in the actual content and then in subsequent interviews, it's rare to see someone like David Lynch that lets you come to your own conclusions. I think that this season of Twin Peaks was able to tie both the first run and the movie together while also being standalone. I also think that the penultimate episode was really beautiful and that the final episode showed just how impossible Dale Coopers attempts to save Laura Palmer ultimately are."

Cavett is an all time great. Few interviewers give their guests such a rub. Find a guest you might be interested in and watch. Tell me who could get more out of them."

The worst thing that Sopranos did was create a spit last season were HBO tries to milk it as much as they can. HBO still does this today and it hurts show that are saddled with this device. "
