        rating: 4.5,
        review: "In the late 80's DC had massive continuity problems. Many of their characters had been turned into mantles and storylines became to convoluted. In an effort to streamline, DC launch Crisis on Infinite Earths. While Crisis was going on Frank Miller was the hottest comic creator in the industry and was writing an out of continuity story The Dark knight Returns. Both books would become all time classics and later become crutches for DC. In order to reset Batman's cannon, Miller wrote Batman: Year One with artist David Mazzucchelli. Unlike DKR which sets the foundation for Elseworlds, Year One is the bedrock that the following 20 years sits. It puts Batman, Gordon, Catwoman and Harvey Dent together early in their careers. It has the grit and grim you'd expect from Miller and the excellent Mazzucchelli art. The only knock on it is that the coloring on the covers isn't really great. Issue one is iconic but the other issues wouldn't have made me buy it off the newsstand."

        rating: 4.5,
        review: "The pairing of Loeb and Sale has created some really great work, mostly in standalone stories. Long Halloween is the best of all of them. Its way better than the rest of their DC books and better than all of the Marvel Color books. Like most mysteries I forgot the whodunit every time I came back and reread it.  Tim Sale villains are still amazing looking even after 25 years. The splash pages in each issue are just incredible. I can only image the price they are going for right now. Its a seminal Batman story that get taken from every time a new movie is written. The only thing is that I don't think that the Godfather references age well."

        rating: 3,
        review: "Haunted Knight is a collection of 3 double sized annuals that each came out around Halloween. It directly led to Long Halloween being launched as a standalone series. Story one is about the Scarecrow and a women who kills her husbands. The second story is about Commissioner Gordon's adopted daughter and the Mad Hatter. The third is sort of a Christmas Carol involving Lucius Fox and Poison Ivy. I though all three stories were good not great and the art was uneven. But I am comparing it to one of the great Batman stories of all time and it is in one of the best Batman series in terms of quality. To put it another way, its not the type of box that if I were buying collected editions that I would need to get an Absolute Edition or a library quality version. Those versions probably have much better coloring than the versions I have read over the years. "

    review: "Dark Victory is the worst of teh 3 Leob and Sale Batman books. Late 90's bad digital coloring almost ruin the art, along with the white paper instead of the grainy paper that DC used to use. But really the problem is with the story. It wants to be a sequel in some parts but it also wants to be its own thing in other parts. Character says one line on page 12 and is killed on page 16. You have no investment in the people being killed and even the people that you do have an investment in, you don't care that they die. The Robin portion is tacked on for sure, but its at least somewhat interesting. In summation, the pencils are great but the coloring is bad. The story never feels important which is saying something considering Loeb is about to explode as a writer."

        isbn: "9781401200602",
        rating: 4,
        review: "If your a writer you want to helm Batman to write detective stories. If your a penciler you want to draw Batman's rogues gallery. Leob's bona fides on Batman had already been established but the chance to see Jim Lee do a full arc on Batman really excited long time comic readers. Lee is one of the most influential artist of his generation but before working with DC he never had the must read story attached to his name. In Hush we get a solid story with on high quality paper with modern coloring. It's as if Lee picked up right were he left off when he left Marvel to form Image. I always got the sense that he was like Speilberg when he started DreamWorks. He did really want to start his own thing and was happy with the status quo. But he also wanted to help his friends who needed his star power to get the venture off the ground, and when there was an opportunity to return, he would slide right back. Hush by itself isn't the greatest comic, however combined with the creativity across the street at the time, it was a touchstone in the last great era of comics. "

    review: "Batman RIP is actually a really great story. Just not in the form that its presented. If you want to read Grant Morrison in full effect then you need to read him in 25, 50 100 issue chunks. The version I read this time was missing much of the lead up and all of the aftermath. If you read Batman's greatest stories a lot of the angles are the same but the work with the subconscious is what is fresh. The re-imagining of Joker and the level of of Damian are the strong and long lasting parts of the story. I read the entire arc as it was coming out and those memories are going to be stronger than the version I read. "

        rating: 4.5,
        review: "In an industry where most of the writers have one idea and protect it like a winning lottery ticket, Grant Morrison never runs out of ideas. You've seen some of his ideas whether you knew it or not. The one good Matrix movie is a blatant rip off of his series The Invisibles. He had a relatively short but productive stint at Marvel in the early 2000s and New X-men was the best of it. New X-Men is at it's best when Frank Quitely is drawing the pages, but thats also close to the start of the run and helps separate it from the rest of the series. The run closes with a more photo realistic Silvestri but thats more of an epilog to the story. There are some interesting ideas that still linger to this day and I also enjoyed Emma Frost in the X-Men. Its hard to explain just how bad off Marvel was before Joe Quesada became Editor-in-Chief. He launched a handful of new imprints and breathed new live into stale characters with his leadership. The company went from almost bankrupt, to having a renaissances and making movies, to being bought by Disney. The state of comics as they are right now(near death), the early 2000s was the last great age of comic books."

        review: "In 1986 two books completely rocked the comics industry. Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns. Of all the different ways that they transformed the industry, one is the way they have popularized the trade paperback. Or more importantly creating stories to fit the trade format. DKR is basically created the Elseworlds imprint. It allowed writers and more importantly readers to enjoy a story sans continuity, something that the DCEU would benefit greatly from.  DKR is Frank Miller at the top of his game using all his tricks. What I don''t know is if we really needed to keep going back to this well 2 more times. But the same could be said for Watchmen. "

        rating: 4,
        review: "It the middle of one the biggest booms in the history of comics, with certain issues selling multiples of millions came KnightFall. It follows the massively successful Death of Superman storyline. The first part of the arc, KnightFall is perfect while Kightquest and KnightsEnd are less than great. The Kelley Jones covers for the storylines were so incredible it made you want to run out and get the issues. When you see Batmans back get broken and thrown in the street its hard to forget than image. Bane instantly became one of the top villains in comics. Also Knightfall has one of the greatest novelizations ever written for a comic. I don't know that the storyline was even done correctly in another media, but it is a seminal work."
