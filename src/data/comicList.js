        review: "In the late 80's DC had massive continuity problems. Many of their characters had been turned into mantles and storylines became to convoluted. In an effort to streamline, DC launch Crisis on Infinite Earths. While Crisis was going on Frank Miller was the hottest comic creator in the industry and was writing an out of continuity story The Dark knight Returns. Both books would become all time classics and later become crutches for DC. In order to reset Batman's cannon, Miller wrote Batman: Year One with artist David Mazzucchelli. Unlike DKR which sets the foundation for Elseworlds, Year One is the bedrock that the following 20 years sits. It puts Batman, Gordon, Catwoman and Harvey Dent together early in their careers. It has the grit and grim you'd expect from Miller and the excellent Mazzucchelli art. The only knock on it is that the coloring on the covers isn't really great. Issue one is iconic but the other issues wouldn't have made me buy it off the newsstand."

        rating: 4.5,
        review: "The pairing of Loeb and Sale has created some really great work, mostly in standalone stories. Long Halloween is the best of all of them. Its way better than the rest of their DC books and better than all of the Marvel Color books. Like most mysteries I forgot the whodunit every time I came back and reread it.  Tim Sale villains are still amazing looking even after 25 years. The splash pages in each issue are just incredible. I can only image the price they are going for right now. Its a seminal Batman story that get taken from every time a new movie is written. The only thing is that I don't think that the Godfather references age well."

        rating: 3,
        review: "Haunted Knight is a collection of 3 double sized annuals that each came out around Halloween. It directly led to Long Halloween being launched as a standalone series. Story one is about the Scarecrow and a women who kills her husbands. The second story is about Commissioner Gordon's adopted daughter and the Mad Hatter. The third is sort of a Christmas Carol involving Lucius Fox and Poison Ivy. I though all three stories were good not great and the art was uneven. But I am comparing it to one of the great Batman stories of all time and it is in one of the best Batman series in terms of quality. To put it another way, its not the type of box that if I were buying collected editions that I would need to get an Absolute Edition or a library quality version. Those versions probably have much better coloring than the versions I have read over the years. "

        review: "In an industry where most of the writers have one idea and protect it like a winning lottery ticket, Grant Morrison never runs out of ideas. You've seen some of his ideas whether you knew it or not. The one good Matrix movie is a blatant rip off of his series The Invisibles. He had a relatively short but productive stint at Marvel in the early 2000s and New X-men was the best of it. New X-Men is at it's best when Frank Quitely is drawing the pages, but thats also close to the start of the run and helps separate it from the rest of the series. The run closes with a more photo realistic Silvestri but thats more of an epilog to the story. There are some interesting ideas that still linger to this day and I also enjoyed Emma Frost in the X-Men. Its hard to explain just how bad off Marvel was before Joe Quesada became Editor-in-Chief. He launched a handful of new imprints and breathed new live into stale characters with his leadership. The company went from almost bankrupt, to having a renaissances and making movies, to being bought by Disney. The state of comics as they are right now(near death), the early 2000s was the last great age of comic books."
