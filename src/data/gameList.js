        review: "It's Halo, but was it a giant step up from the other games? I'm not sure. There were parts that felt very Call of Duty. Also I always felt like a was just going through different difficulty of waves of enemies and then the level would end. After playing for 20 minutes I could tell you how the last level would play out. As far as the story I really couldn't tell you what it was about. I lost the plot years ago. Vide game stories still haven't got any better."

        rating: 5,
        review: "One of the reasons I've never been much of a PC gamer is the fact that the games seem to alway need faster an faster hardware. Half Life was different in it seemed to play on every computer I've every had since it came out.  It had a great story and was fun to play, but also it had a large mod community. It also came with a fully featured level maker in WorldCraft. For me, it's the greatest PC game ever made."

        rating: 5,
        review: "There almost more surrounding the game than the game itself. From it role as almost a tech demo for the PS2 to the demo and then the character change midway. As the years have gone bye, all the noise has gone away and the game itself is seen as the masterpiece it always was. If all it did was successfully transition the MGS franchise from PS1 to PS2 it would have been an achievement, but much more both for the series and for PS2. "

        rating: 5,
        review: "The granddaddy of all fps. Gaming and ID software ran way passed it with Doom and Quake, but Wolfenstein was more fun to play and a thriller instead of horror. The single color ceiling and floors increased the claustrophobia. It really impossible to even relate it to modern gaming, but it to gaming from platform and turned it squarely into 3d. Platform gaming would quickly die on PC's and while taking a couple of generations to lose ground on consoles."

        title: "Resident Evil 2",
        rating: 5,
        review: "The original Playstation had some really great games that demanded sequels. Some never really went any further than the Ps1. Some are still around today. Resident Evil made an impact from day one, so when RE2 came out I had to get it day one. 2 discs and 2 separate characters gave you your monies worth. It was an improvement in every way from its predecessor. Well except for the series standard controls."
