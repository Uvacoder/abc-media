        review: "Pairs well with JFK as they're contemporary. Every time I watch it it get better and better. Edward Fox is perfect as the Jackal but Lebel steals the entire movie. This movie was remade as a bad but fun movie in the 90's, if it was remade today... well I can only imagine the ham-handedness. This movie only comes around the streaming services once a year so if you get a chance - see it."

        review: "Deep Cover is a very good movie. Fishburne and Goldblum are tremendous as dealers. Seeing it in 2021 instead of on TV in the 90's, the major difference is how clean and clear the picture is. Its such a tight movie time wise that it almost becomes a negative in the change of the characters. In a lot of the ways a movie like King Of New York stumbles, Deep Cover succeeds. Two problems I had with the movie were: the beginning jump cuts and the intro that gave me the feeling of sea sickness. They were inconsistent with the rest of the movie. Secondly I thought the Tom Clancy type ending was a little much."

But thats a problem with most comedies though. Secondly, Harold Ramis is the start of this movie. The best laughs are from him. Just him in the background goofing on the other solders is a riot. In the end though Stripes is best watched if you stop watching at about the 90 minute mark."

        review: "A movie a that Michael Eisner tried to burry. It really should have been better supported by the studio because it's Michael Mann making a less stylized thriller, more of a grown up movie. The scene with everyone yelling in the newsroom as the tension rises is probably the highlight. Pacino on the beach in the dark though is a classic Mann shot. You believe that Crowe has a temper and could snap at any moment. It might not be a top 5 Mann movie, but it would be a top movie for all but a few directors. "

Every time I rewatch the movie it becomes more about the character and less about the story and the great ending.  Could've been called No One Gets Out Alive even though thats not true. It's all here: private eye, L.A. and murder but in the New Hollywood style that only became appreciated after the fact. Whats really interesting to me is that all the characters are in transition, unlike most movies where almost all the characters are stagnant. I can't wait to watch it again when it pops up."

Not why should I care about The Suicide Squad, but rather why should I care about any superhero movie? At first it was cool to see comic characters and parts of story arcs from the comics on screen. But now comics movies are on rail rollercoaster rides that go nowhere and say nothing. There was a time when video games wanted to be movies, but now movies want to be video games. The Squad did a hell of a lot of platform jumping, and anyone who saw last years Rick and Morty episode new exactly what the javelin was for. There were parts of the movie that were funny, at least funnier than the Marvel movies have been. Just remember, don't think too hard and ..... consume consume consume."

It has one of the greatest villains of all time against one of movies greatest hero actors.

        review: "Moneyball is a very rewatchable movie that glides from scene to scene. It's as good as the book it's based and there is some really great casting. The real problem with Moneyball though is that it has spread to all sports and intrenched it followers in front offices across leagues. In an attempt to become the next Peter Brand, everybody creates new pseudostats that are guaranteed to help you find the next great team. These stats then spread to all teams and alter the play of the games. Brad Pitt not watching games isn't a quirk of Billy Beane, it's a tenet of Sabermetrics. You need only look that the advanced analytics to see what happened in the game. Day to day gameplay has become unwatchable and the each sport has morphed into an almost yearly race to alter the sport to target the next hip stat. "

It's both too long and too short at the same time. There are a lot of storylines that could have been fleshed out over a series but a given short shrift  We have now reached the era in which movie writing has come down to the quality of video game writing. From a golden age of TV to an era of quantity over quality. I will say that Dave Bautista is really good as an action star that can play vulnerable. When he puts his reading glasses on in a movie a 300lber is suddenly becomes fragile."

I miss video rental stores and I was a charter member when Netflix started but I have no love for Blockbuster. This movie plays like a Netflix and Blockbuster joint propaganda film. Modern documentaries come in three forms; Netflix has the needlessly long docs, HBO has docs that lately are just rehashes of stories from the 90's or the omnipresent doc about that claims to be about a subject but is really is all about the director for some reason.

The jump cuts in this movie are very important to the viewer because they basically excuse all Michele's bad behaviour. When he does something terrible we know he does it, and yet because we never saw it we are not rooting against him. In fact we are rooting for him. He is almost out but then he's betrayed. Michele's is a bad guy from the beginning, but over the course of the movie it plays like we are watching an attorneys defense of him. This movie had me when they mentioned Bob le Flambeur and they really had me when Jean-Pierre Melville showed up.  "

The movie zips along while on cable stuffed with commercials(how most people watched it) it takes forever. The score is tremendous. Theres a nice Battleship Potemkin send up on the stairs. It's really De Palma saying he could be an all time great if wanted to, but he'd rather follow his own interests. "

I think that a major issue With West Wing besides the post Sorkin era, is that the pilot plays less like a continuation of The American President an more like slamming on the brakes."

Modern writers seem to think that they are the first generation to bring politics into movies, but thats ignorance on their part. Writers from older generations were just as political, they were just better at burying the message so that you came to the realization yourself. Rather than spending 2 hours preaching to the converted and turning off anybody who's mind you could change. A great cast, its  like a great crock pot meal. Almost everyone in this movie by themselves would make any movie their in better. Makes me want to go bak and watch Clue."
